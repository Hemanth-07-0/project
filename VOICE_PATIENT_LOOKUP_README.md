# 🎤 Voice-Based Patient Record Lookup System

This system integrates **Dwani AI** voice recognition with the doctor interface record section to enable patients to find their medical records using voice commands.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Patient Workflow:
1. **Voice Input**: Patient speaks their name into the microphone
2. **Dwani AI Processing**: Voice is converted to text using Dwani AI API
3. **Database Search**: System searches for patient records matching the spoken name
4. **Results Display**: Matching medical records are displayed in the patient interface

### Doctor Workflow:
1. **Record Upload**: Doctors upload patient files through the doctor interface (`patient-records.html`)
2. **Patient Association**: Files are linked to patient names in the database
3. **Voice Recognition**: When patients speak their names, the system finds matching files
4. **Automatic Display**: Matching records appear in `patient-health-records.html`

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes:
- **New API Endpoint**: `/voice/transcribe-and-search` - Combines voice transcription with record lookup
- **Database Integration**: Searches patient records by name using fuzzy matching
- **Record Retrieval**: Returns patient information and associated medical files

### Frontend Changes:
- **Enhanced UI**: `patient-health-records.html` now displays matching records after voice recognition
- **Record Display**: Shows patient name, file details, and action buttons
- **Download/View**: Patients can view or download their medical records

```

## 🎯 Features

### Voice Recognition:
- **Multi-language Support**: English, Hindi, Kannada
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Finds records even with slight pronunciation variations
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate results after voice input

### Record Display:
- **Patient Information**: Shows patient name and record count
- **File Details**: Displays file name, type, size, and upload date
- **Action Buttons**: View and download functionality for each record
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Security:
- **Database Integration**: Records are securely stored and retrieved
- **Access Control**: Only displays records for matching patient names
- **File Protection**: Secure download links for medical documents

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Backend dependencies should already be installed
# If not, run: pip install -r backend-api/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Setup Test Data
```bash
# Add sample patient records for testing
python test_data_setup.py
```

### 3. Start the Backend Server
```bash
# Start the Flask backend
python backend-api/run.py
```

### 4. Open the Patient Interface
```bash
# Open in your browser
open public/patient-health-records.html
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Patients Available:
- **John Doe** - Has blood test results, X-ray report, prescription history
- **Jane Smith** - Has annual checkup, vaccination record
- **Michael Johnson** - Has MRI scan report, cardiology report
- **Sarah Williams** - Has diabetes management plan, glucose lab results

### Testing Steps:
1. Open `public/patient-health-records.html` in your browser
2. Select your preferred language (English/Hindi/Kannada)
3. Click "🎤 START RECORDING"
4. Speak one of the test patient names clearly
5. Click "⏹️ STOP RECORDING"
6. Wait for Dwani AI to process your voice
7. View the matching medical records that appear below

### Expected Results:
- Voice input is transcribed and displayed
- Matching patient records are found and displayed
- You can view file details and download records
- System shows appropriate messages for no matches

## 🔄 Integration Points

### With Doctor Interface:
- Records uploaded in `patient-records.html` are automatically available for voice lookup
- Patient names in the database are used for voice matching
- File associations are maintained through the existing database structure

### With Dwani AI:
- Uses existing Dwani AI configuration and API keys
- Leverages the same voice-to-text pipeline
- Extends functionality to include database search

### With Database:
- Searches `patients` table for name matches
- Retrieves associated records from `records` table
- Maintains data integrity and security

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **No Records Found**: Ensure test data is loaded and patient names are spoken clearly
2. **Backend Connection Failed**: Check that the Flask server is running on port 5000
3. **Microphone Access Denied**: Allow microphone permissions in your browser
4. **Dwani AI Errors**: Verify API key and internet connection

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify backend server logs for API errors
3. Test voice transcription without record search first
4. Ensure database contains patient records

## 📝 Notes

- This system links Dwani AI voice recognition with the existing doctor interface record section
- Patient records are displayed based on voice input matching patient names in the database
- The system maintains security by only showing records for matching patient names
- Files uploaded by doctors through the record section are automatically available for voice lookup
